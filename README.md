## Mouse lifespan synaptome project

Created by Zhen Qiu


### Introduction
Matlab code to generate figures of the our recent submisson to Science  for the manuscript 'Cizeron, M.*, Qiu, Z.*, Koniaris, B., Gokhale, R., Komiyama, N., Frans√©n, E., Grant, S.G.N. (2020). A brain-wide atlas of synapses across the mouse lifespan. (* Equal contribution)'.

### Prerequisites
1. Mathworks Matlab 2014b or above
2. export_fig: A MATLAB toolbox for exporting publication quality figures https://github.com/altmany/export_fig
3. Matlab Toolbox for Bayesian Estimation (MBE) https://github.com/NilsWinter/matlab-bayesian-estimation


### Descriptions
1. compare_3Mto18M_full_parameter.m
Matlab code to geneate Figure. 1C: compare the puncta parameters of 3M with that of 18M in 109 brain regions, 
2. compare_3Mto18M_subtypes.m
Matlab code to geneate Figure. S13: compare the puncta subtype densities of 37 sbutypes between 3M with that of 18M in 109 brain regions, 
3. compare_hypersimi_2Wto3M_2Wto18M
matlab code to test if the 18M, in contrast to 3M, is more similart to 2W. (18M2W V.S. 3M2W). THis was done by using the hypersimilarity matrix Figure 3C
